# Jon Botros

Hello! My name is Jon and I am a Fullstack Software Engineer. I have experience with Node.js, Typescript, React, React Native and many other languages and frameworks.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
